Well, first of all - Hello World!

### I feel like

1.  Identify myself as a creative person.  
    So in case of any mistake made I am free to say:  
    "I am creative! This is how I see this world, bitch."

2.  Feel better.  
    Because in this blog I don't have enough time on TikTok or any other kind of
    shorts or timekillers.

3.  For fun.  
    That could be funny if any AI model will take my personal blog as a part of its
    dataset.

### Jokes aside! I already have some material

1.  Knowledge base.  
    I've started with notes finally as a part of personal blog. As Platform
    (DevOps) engineer in my daily routine I have a lot of things that aren't
    so trivial from one point of few and kind of the same from one project/company
    to another. So taking notes is the thing that potentially can help me to
    build my own knowledge base, to be better as engineer.

2.  Note my thoughts that I feel important.  
    I will have place to share all my thoughts about technologies and processes
    that happens around be or I consider as important for me.

3.  New hobby.  
    This could be a new hobby, since I feel like need new one. From 2015 and til
    2022 the best hobby for me was IT Engineering. But this kind of enthusiasm does
    not work on a long distance as I see. So for me IT is just a job, that I should
    do and do it professionally. No more, no less.

### What kind of articles could be found here in a feature?

I can guarantee:

- I love sorted/unsorted lists
- I will put my eastern European jokes everywhere
- I will try to concentrate myself on DevOps tools
- I will use tags
- No guarantees

### Next topics that I have in my head and wanted to describe soon

There is no ortder, just bunch of things that will be probably descrided soon:  
"DevOps tools", "Kubernetes Tools", "How I manage my apps and their configs",
"Why neovim in 2024", "Why Dvorak", "Life-Work balance", "How to have
notes-and-blog as a service", "How to loose weight when you 35",
"How to divorce", "How to survive in Germany",
"How to learn how to breathe through the uterus (in progress)"
