title: I’m Coming Back (with Ideas)
---

Hey there! 👋

It’s been a while since I last posted anything here — but today, I’m coming back with fresh energy, new ideas, and a desire to
**document and share my journey** as a DevOps engineer, indie learner, and explorer of systems — both digital and mental.

## 🛠️ A bit about me

I work as a **DevOps engineer**, mainly focused on:

- Infrastructure-as-Code (Terraform, Ansible and so on)
- CI/CD systems (GitLab CI, GitHub Actions)
- Kubernetes (Helm, Kustomize, FluxCD, ArgoCD)
- GitOps and modern deployment flows
- Secrets management (HashiCorp Vault, SOPS)
- Security and compliance (Open Policy Agent, Kyverno)
- Other tools and practices that help teams deliver software faster and more reliably

Also I like drawing diagrams by hand, tinkering with my own setup, and reflecting on how systems behave — or break.

## ✍️ Why I’m writing again

Recently I realized: I often build things, experiment, or solve infrastructure puzzles — but rarely document them **in a way that helps others**
or even helps _me_ in the long run.

This blog will now be:

- A notebook for my technical findings and patterns
- A sketchbook for hand-drawn infra/DevOps concepts
- A place to connect tech with thoughtfulness

Whether it’s setting up GitOps from scratch, making secrets management less painful, or just visualizing weird systems —
I want to share what I learn.  
This also will be mostly based on my own notes that I am doing for a long period of time already.

## 🔮 What's coming next?

First of all I would like to put at least some of the structure in my blog.
So I will start with Tags, that should reflect main topics and also complexity level from my subjective point of view.  
This should help to navigate over posts and find something interesting exact for you.

Here’s what I might explore in upcoming posts:

- Explaining GitHub pages structure that I’m using
- Cloud infrastructure from the top to the bottom
- Why I still hand-write diagrams
- Why and how I make notes on a daily management
- Downsides of the huge cloud platforms
- Implementation how-to's for specific nowadays tools

Maybe I’ll also embed a few videos from YouTube along the way — I woon’t shy away from that.

Besides tech, I also plan to write a bit about my life experience — especially as someone living in Germany, adjusting to new surroundings,
and watching my daughter grow up in a culture that’s both familiar and different. There’s a lot I’d like to capture: small moments,
parenting thoughts, and the personal side of building a life abroad.
